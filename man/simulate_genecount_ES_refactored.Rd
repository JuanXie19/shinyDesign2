\title{(Refactored) Simulate expression counts for a single gene}
\usage{
simulate_genecount_ES_refactored(
  SEED,
  coords_norm_sub,
  coords_norm_out,
  nnGP_fit,
  seqDepth_factor,
  ES_factor,
  gene_count_row,
  all_spot_names,
  spot_idx
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SEED}{Integer random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{coords_norm_sub}{Data frame of normalized coordinates for spots within the domain.}

\item{coords_norm_out}{Data frame of normalized coordinates for spots outside the domain.}

\item{nnGP_fit}{Fitted NNGP model object for the gene.}

\item{seqDepth_factor}{Numeric scaling factor for sequencing depth.}

\item{ES_factor}{Numeric scaling factor for effect size.}

\item{gene_count_row}{Numeric vector of counts for the gene of interest.}

\item{all_spot_names}{Character vector of all spot names (column names of original count matrix).}

\item{spot_idx}{Numeric vector indicating indices of spots within the domain.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of simulated counts for all spots, ordered according to \code{all_spot_names}.
}
\description{
A vectorized version of \code{simulate_genecount_ES}, designed to reduce memory usage by working
with a single gene vector instead of the full count matrix.
